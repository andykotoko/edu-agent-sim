# Edu-Agent-Sim
A small C++ classroom simulation project by a freshman CS student at Shanghai University. I’ll keep updating it as I learn more about OOP, randomness, and maybe some agent/AI ideas.



Hey! 👋  
I'm a freshman CS major at **Shanghai University**, and this is one of my early C++ projects.  
Honestly, I'm just messing around and trying to get better at coding, so I built a small teacher–student simulation for fun.

Here’s what it does:

- There are **three teachers**, each with a name in a different language (Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English — why? no idea, I just thought it was funny).  
- You type in their base level, and the program mixes it with some random stats to give each teacher a final score.  
- That score turns into a grade (A–E), which decides how many students they end up with.  
- Students get randomly picked nicknames and scores (normal distribution because… why not).  

It’s super small (~170 lines), but I’m planning to **keep adding stuff** as I learn more C++ and maybe AI.  
Who knows — this thing might turn into a tiny “teacher agent simulator” someday LOL.

Anyway, thanks for checking it out! 🚀
